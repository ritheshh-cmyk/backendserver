Instructions to build and package the Electron app into an exe:

1. Build the React app using Vite:
   npm run build

2. Package the Electron app into an exe using electron-builder:
   npm run electron:build

This will first build the React app into the "dist/public" directory, then package the Electron app including the built React app and main process script into an installer exe for Windows.

If you encounter any errors during the build or packaging process, please share the error messages so I can assist in fixing them.
